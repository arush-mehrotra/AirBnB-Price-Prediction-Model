# AirBnB-Price-Prediction-Model


For our final project, we sought to better understand the drivers of price for various AirBnB listings in New York City in the year 2019. To that end, we selected two datasets. The first dataset `airbnb_ddf` contains the price, geographical location, neighborhood, room type, reviews and other features for various AirBnB listings. The second dataset `crime_ddf` is more granular: it reflects the details of various crimes committed across New York City, including their classification (felony, misdemeanor, or violation) and geographical location. Aggregating these results and merging them with our previous dataset, we are able to develop a holistic understanding of both the intrinsic factors (e.g., room type, reviews) and external factors (crime levels) that drive listing price.
